# Project 1 - To Do List App
### "Epic Tasks" by Rob Errera

"Epic Tasks" is a to do list app with a gamified twist to it. The concept is that each time a task is crossed off the list, experience points are awarded as a motivational tool, and the user gains a level every 75XP. There is also a tally of how many tasks the user has completed. Those are tracked based on tasks a user has deleted by long-pressing on a task (lists can also be deleted this way). When all tasks have been completed, a castle shows up with a classic Mario-themed message: "Your tasks are in another castle."

The prototype can be seen in the screenshot/ folder.

This app was built for a minimum API 16 and max API 23. It uses Material Design's official floating action button icon.

*Bugs:*
 - When tapping on a list for the first, the list name is added as a task. That task can be deleted and will not be automatically added again on future openings of that list.
 - When typing a new task while the castle image is onscreen, the text clashes with the castle image.
 - In horizontal orientation, the castle text comes very close to the EditText field and could be laid out better.
